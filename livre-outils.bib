Due to the economical importance of the products, it is important to know who are the ones who have the largest influence to the products. Is there a dominant player in developing communities? In this paper1 the aspect is studied with respect to the Linux Kernel community. We show that the influence is centered to a small number of core people, and corporates have a large impact to the development. Moreover, we enumerate the most influential companies.},

  abstract = {Scholars routinely make claims that presuppose the validity of the observations and measurements that operationalize their concepts. Yet, despite recent advances in political science methods, surprisingly little attention has been devoted to measurement validity. We address this gap by exploring four themes. First, we seek to establish a shared framework that allows quantitative and qualitative scholars to assess more effectively, and communicate about, issues of valid measurement. Second, we underscore the need to draw a clear distinction between measurement issues and disputes about concepts. Third, we discuss the contextual specificity of measurement claims, exploring a variety of measurement strategies that seek to combine generality and validity by devoting greater attention to context. Fourth, we address the proliferation of terms for alternative measurement validation procedures and offer an account of the three main types of validation most relevant to political scientists.},

In this paper we describe the FOCSE metrics framework, supporting a specific selection process for security-related open source code. FOCSE is based on a set of general purpose metrics suitable for evaluating open source frameworks in general; however, it includes some specific metrics expressing security solutions’ capability of responding to continuous change in threats. We show FOCSE at work in two use cases about selecting two different types of security-related open source solutions, i.e. Single Sign-On and Secure Shell applications.},

  abstract = {modelsummary is a package to summarize data and statistical models in R. It supports over one hundred types of models out-of-the-box, and allows users to report the results of those models side-by-side in a table, or in coefficient plots. It makes it easy to execute common tasks such as computing robust standard errors, adding significance stars, and manipulating coefficient and model labels. Beyond model summaries, the package also includes a suite of tools to produce highly flexible data summary tables, such as dataset overviews, correlation matrices, (multi-level) cross-tabulations, and balance tables (also known as "Table 1"). The appearance of the tables produced by modelsummary can be customized using external packages such as kableExtra, gt, flextable, or huxtable; the plots can be customized using ggplot2. Tables can be exported to many output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, Text/Markdown, Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, RTF, PDF, and image files. Tables and plots can be embedded seamlessly in rmarkdown, knitr, or Sweave dynamic documents. The modelsummary package is designed to be simple, robust, modular, and extensible.},

We distinguish between different types of scoping studies and indicate where these stand in relation to full systematic reviews. We outline a framework for conducting a scoping study based on our recent experiences of reviewing the literature on services for carers for people with mental health problems. Where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users. Finally, we consider the advantages and limitations of the approach and suggest that a wider debate is called for about the role of the scoping study in relation to other types of literature reviews.},

It was only towards the very end of 2010 that the term began to register, just ahead of an explosion of interest from 2011 onwards. In this commentary we take the opportunity to reflect back on the claims we made in that original paper in light of more recent discussions about the social scientific implications of the inundation of digital data. Did our paper, with its emphasis on the emergence of, what we termed, ‘social transactional data’ and ‘digital byproduct data’ prefigure contemporary debates that now form the basis and rationale for this excellent new journal? Or was the paper more concerned with broader methodological, theoretical and political debates that have somehow been lost in all of the loud babble that has come to surround Big Data. Using recent work on the BBC Great British Class Survey as an example this brief paper offers a reflexive and critical reflection on what has become – much to the surprise of its authors – one of the most cited papers in the discipline of sociology in the last decade.},

The success of a project is often related to the number of developers it can attract: a larger community of developers (the ‘bazaar’) identifies and corrects more software defects and adds more features via a peer-review process. In this paper two free software projects (Wine and Arla) are empirically explored in order to characterize their software lifecycle, development processes and communities. Both the projects show a phase where the number of active developers and the actual work performed on the system is constant, or does not grow: we argued that this phase corresponds to the one termed ‘cathedral’ in the literature. One of the two projects (Wine) shows also a second phase: a sudden growing amount of developers corresponds to a similar growing output produced: we termed this as the ‘bazaar’ phase, and we also argued that this phase was not achieved for the other system. A further analysis revealed that the transition between ‘cathedral’ and ‘bazaar’ was a phase by itself in Wine, achieved by creating a growing amount of new modules, which attracted new developers.},

Unfortunately, accessing publications from many reputed journals comes at a high cost—a cost that many researchers and institutions cannot afford. Although, openaccess publication model is considered by many as a possible route to ensure that science is free for all; however, it is fraught with its own challenges. This review attempts at exploring the possibilities of keeping science accessible. Firstly, we re-visit the meaning of “open science” as a comprehensive concept which includes open source, data, access, resources, peer review etc. and not merely open access publication model. Next, we have discussed the global initiatives towards open access—the Budapest Open Access Initiative, Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing, Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities, cOAlition S and its Plan S initiative, UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science and the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). Following this we have included the various open access initiatives from India. In the next part, we have focused on problems with dissemination of scientific outcomes and the challenges associated with existing publication models. Finally, we explore the possible solutions to the existing challenges, which include promotion of pre-print servers and other ideas that we have detailed in the manuscript.},

This paper presents a method for integrating data about open source projects by way of matching projects (entities) and deleting duplicates across multiple code repositories. After a review of the relevant literature, a few of the methods are chosen and applied to the FLOSS domain, including a simple scoring system for confidence in pairwise project matches. Finally, the paper describes limitations of this approach and recommendations for future work.},

A key player in the early Victorian statistical movement—he served as editor to the journal of the Statistical Society of London from 1842 until his death in 1854—Fletcher created works reflecting the group's sentiments, reformist in their own right, and relied on the preponderance of statistics to make his positions clear. Fletcher's first map appeared in his 1847 manuscript on moral and educational statistics and was not thematic, but a general map of British counties that required the reader to apply the theme by connecting tabular data to it. In 1857, Hinton Rowan Helper, a North Carolina native and son of a slave owner, called for the end of slavery in the United States, using every conceivable argument available to him to make the case that slavery was wrong for the South.},

Statistical graphics in a sense can help to generate new hypotheses and make great leaps in our fundamental understanding of the world. Interactive statistical graphics, which takes plotting numbers a step further, were born in the excitement of the computer graphics revolution. Picturing, Rotation, Isolation, and Masking up to nine dimensions (PRIM-9) was part of John Tukey's body of research in exploratory data analysis that foreshadowed today's data mining research. Linking was not a feature for PRIM-9, because linking is used when there are multiple plots visible, a style that emerged a decade beyond PRIM-9's days. Tours provide sequences of low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional data. The PRIM-9 video is piece of theatre— staged, scripted, and substantive.},

The chapter presents the mainstream adoption of FOSS and a survey of some of the research to date on FOSS. It describes in more detail some of the aspects of FOSS. Public administrations around the world have also embraced FOSS as a way to reduce costs or assert their sovereignty, and many social activists use it to develop autonomous infrastructures.

Our aim is to explore the intersection between FOSS and computational reproducibility. We begin by situating FOSS in relation to other ‘open’ initiatives, and specifically open science, open research, and open scholarship. In this context, we argue that anyone who actively contributes to the research process today is a computational researcher, in that they use computers to manage and store information. We then provide a primer to FOSS suitable for anyone concerned with research quality and sustainability—including researchers in any field, as well as support staff, administrators, publishers, funders, and so on. Next, we illustrate how the notions introduced in the primer apply to resources for scientific computing, with reference to the GNU Scientific Library as a case study. We conclude by discussing why the common interpretation of ‘open source’ as ‘open code’ is misplaced, and we use this example to articulate the role of FOSS in research and scholarship today. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Reliability and reproducibility in computational science: implementing verification, validation and uncertainty quantification in silico’.},

Between roughly 1850 and 1900 (±10), an explosive growth occurred in both the general use of graphic methods and the range of topics to which they were applied. Innovations were prodigious and some of the most exquisite graphics ever produced appeared, resulting in what may be called the "Golden Age of Statistical Graphics." In this article I trace the origins of this period in terms of the infrastructure required to produce this explosive growth: recognition of the importance of systematic data collection by the state; the rise of statistical theory and statistical thinking; enabling developments of technology; and inventions of novel methods to portray statistical data. To illustrate, I describe some specific contributions that give rise to the appellation "Golden Age."},

  abstract = {Open Access (OA) is an evolving publication model that is heavily supported by politics and science organizations aiming to make scientific knowledge more accessible to a wider audience. Whether it will indeed alter scholarly communication, however, depends on researchers’ underlying attitudes, motivations, and needs. Drawing on group discussions and interviews (n = 42), this study explores the perceptions, attitudes and behaviours of researchers towards OA publishing. We focus on researchers in the field of biomedical and health informatics located in different global regions and from different seniority levels. Overall, the results show that whilst most researchers support the idea of making scientific knowledge freely accessible to everyone, they are hesitant about actually living this practice by choosing OA journals to publish their own work. Article processing charges and quality issues are perceived as the main obstacles in this respect, revealing a two-sided evaluation of OA models, reflecting the different viewpoints of researchers as authors or readers. The results further highlight hitherto underexplored influencing factors regarding institutional frame conditions, located on the level of the scientific system, the publication service providers or the national/international OA policies.},

Here we examine breakthroughs over the past decade that include self-supervised learning, which allows models to be trained on vast amounts of unlabelled data, and geometric deep learning, which leverages knowledge about the structure of scientific data to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Generative AI methods can create designs, such as small-molecule drugs and proteins, by analysing diverse data modalities, including images and sequences. We discuss how these methods can help scientists throughout the scientific process and the central issues that remain despite such advances. Both developers and users of AI toolsneed a better understanding of when such approaches need improvement, and challenges posed by poor data quality and stewardship remain. These issues cut across scientific disciplines and require developing foundational algorithmic approaches that can contribute to scientific understanding or acquire it autonomously, making them critical areas of focus for AI innovation.},

In this paper we discuss the nature of the open source process, how it functions, and the motivations with regards to participation that developers self-report. We then explain the impact of these elements of the open source process as they relate to adaptive accessibility software. We use some specific examples of issues raised from the adoption of open source via a discussion of the ACCESS Framework, an accessibility engine designed to provide cross-platform accessibility support through plug-ins.},

In this field, data is the new resource, and knowledge is extracted from materials datasets that are too big or complex for traditional human reasoning—typically with the intent to discover new or improved materials or materials phenomena. Multiple factors, including the open science movement, national funding, and progress in information technology, have fueled its development. Such related tools as materials databases, machine learning, and high-throughput methods are now established as parts of the materials research toolset. However, there are a variety of challenges that impede progress in data-driven materials science: data veracity, integration of experimental and computational data, data longevity, standardization, and the gap between industrial interests and academic efforts. In this perspective article, the historical development and current state of data-driven materials science, building from the early evolution of open science to the rapid expansion of materials data infrastructures are discussed. Key successes and challenges so far are also reviewed, providing a perspective on the future development of the field.},

  abstract = {Data visualization aims to effectively communicate quantitative information by understanding which techniques and displays work better for different circumstances and why. There are a variety of software solutions capable of generating a multitude of different visualizations of the same dataset. However, data visualization exposes a large space of visual configurations depending on the type of data to be visualized, the different displays (e.g., scatter plots, line graphs, pie charts), the visual components to encode the data (e.g., lines, dots, bars), or the specific visual attributes of those components (e.g., color, shape, size, length). Researchers and developers are not usually aware about best practices in data visualization, and they are required to learn about both the design practices that make communication effective and the low level details of the specific software tool used to generate the visualization. This paper proposes a software product line approach to model and materialize the variability of the visualization design process, guided by feature models. We encode the visualization knowledge regarding the best design practices, resolve the variability following a step-wise configuration approach, and then evaluate our proposal for a specific software visualization tool. Our solution helps researchers and developers communicate their quantitative results effectively by assisting them in the selection and generation of the visualizations that work best for each case. We open a new window of research where data visualization and variability meet each other.},

  abstract = {Background: Reflection is well established as an important part of teacher education, but it is also the focus of critical enquiry. This means that reflection is of interest to those who wish to explore its use to produce ‘better’ teachers. It is also of interest to scholars who are interested in the wider implications of reflection, for example, in relation to power and social control. Academic articles are the primary medium through which ideas and practices are communicated. However, they can only contribute if they are accepted for publication on the basis of making a contribution to knowledge. To be seen in this way, a journal paper needs to cite earlier work to show understanding of this work and how this is being augmented. Purpose: This paper aims to initiate an academic debate of citation practices which, it argues, should be based on an awareness of current practices and a willingness to share, and even change, them. To facilitate the debate and the development of a better understanding of citing and its implications, the paper offers a tripartite citation framework. Sources of evidence: The extensive citation analysis literature is reviewed to provide a context for an examination of the variety of citation practices found in 24 papers, which all focus on initial teacher education and which cite the same critical paper (Fendler, L., Teacher reflection in a hall of mirrors: Historical influences and political reverberations. Educational Researcher, 32, no. 3: 16–25, 2003; doi: 10.3102/0013189X032003016). Main argument: This paper argues that there is value in differentiating three categories of citation, labelled ‘cameo’, ‘supporting role’ and ‘star’. These categories do not make judgements about what counts as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ referencing. Rather, they provide a way for authors to assess how they are citing and what the possible consequences may be. These can include an apparent lack of understanding not just of a cited paper but also of the wider literature. This means that citation that is not being carefully managed can undermine an argument. Conclusions: This paper concludes that there is there is a need to initiate an academic debate about citation which is premised on the development of self-awareness about current practice and its consequences. Such a debate could bring about a number of benefits. It would encourage individual scholars to develop self-aware and ethical citation; it would also clarify current expectations about citation and enable academic communities to reflect on whether enquiry is well served by them.},

Yet in computational hydrology the code and data that actually produces published results are not regularly made available, inhibiting the ability of the community to reproduce and verify previous findings. In order to overcome this problem we recommend that reuseable code and formal workflows, which unambiguously reproduce published scientific results, are made available for the community alongside data, so that we can verify previous findings, and build directly from previous work. In cases where reproducing large-scale hydrologic studies is computationally very expensive and time-consuming, new processes are required to ensure scientific rigor. Such changes will strongly improve the transparency of hydrological research, and thus provide a more credible foundation for scientific advancement and policy support.},

Employing a “microhistories” methodology, we document how actors in the free/open-source movement took steps that enabled an alternate technological niche to form, gain momentum and eventually infiltrate the extant regime. Our account delineates the key role that actors play in shaping the identity of a niche, amplifying its presence, and finally mainstreaming it. We observe a heterogenous response by incumbents to the emergent niche and highlight the sustained coexistence of a niche and regime as a distinct form of technological transition. Finally, we demonstrate the significant impact that a niche can have, spanning beyond the targeted regime, and becoming part of the landscape. Our insights highlight how tracing the processes involved in the emergence and development of a niche can provide a prospective and generative understanding of technological transition, thereby contributing to and complementing the extant SNM and MLP literatures.},

In this manuscript, we assess code sharing and model documentation practices of 7500 publications about individual-based and agent-based models. The code availability increased over the years, up to 18\% in 2018. Model documentation does not include all the elements that could improve the transparency of the models, such as mathematical equations, flow charts, and pseudocode. We find that articles with equations and flow charts being cited more among other model papers, probably because the model documentation is more transparent. The practices of code sharing improve slowly over time, partly due to the emergence of more public repositories and archives, and code availability requirements by journals and sponsors. However, a significant change in norms and habits need to happen before computational modeling becomes a reproducible science.},

Kelty investigates the history and cultural significance of Free Software, revealing the people and practices that have transformed not only software but also music, film, science, and education. Free Software is a set of practices devoted to the collaborative creation of software source code that is made openly and freely available through an unconventional use of copyright law. Kelty explains how these specific practices have reoriented the relations of power around the creation, dissemination, and authorization of all kinds of knowledge. He also makes an important contribution to discussions of public spheres and social imaginaries by demonstrating how Free Software is a "recursive public"--a public organized around the ability to build, modify, and maintain the very infrastructure that gives it life in the first place. Drawing on ethnographic research that took him from an Internet healthcare start-up company in Boston to media labs in Berlin to young entrepreneurs in Bangalore, Kelty describes the technologies and the moral vision that bind together hackers, geeks, lawyers, and other Free Software advocates. In each case, he shows how their practices and way of life include not only the sharing of software source code but also ways of conceptualizing openness, writing copyright licenses, coordinating collaboration, and proselytizing. By exploring in detail how these practices came together as the Free Software movement from the 1970s to the 1990s, Kelty also considers how it is possible to understand the new movements emerging from Free Software: projects such as Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that creates copyright licenses, and Connexions, a project to create an online scholarly textbook commons.},

DEA offers several advantages: It is a non-parametric optimization method without any need for the user to define any relations between different factors or a production function, can account for economies or diseconwhile omies of scale, and is able to deal with multi-input, multi-output systems in which the factors have different scales. Using a data set of 30 open source project retrieved from SourceForge.net, we demonstrate the application of DEA, showing that the efficiency of the projects is in general relatively high. Regarding the effects of tool employment on the efficiency of projects, the results were surprising: Most of the possible tools, and overall usage, showed a negative relationship to efficiency.},

  abstract = {Bringing together scholars from around the world, this collection examines many of the historical developments in making data visible through charts, graphs, thematic maps, and now interactive displays.  Today, we are used to seeing data portrayed in a dizzying array of graphic forms. Virtually any quantified knowledge, from social and physical science to engineering and medicine, as well as business, government, or personal activity, has been visualized. Yet the methods of making data visible are relatively new innovations, most stemming from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century innovations that arose as a logical response to a growing desire to quantify everything-from science, economics, and industry to population, health, and crime. Innovators such as Playfair, Alexander von Humboldt, Heinrich Berghaus, John Snow, Florence Nightingale, Francis Galton, and Charles Minard began to develop graphical methods to make data and their relations more visible. In the twentieth century, data design became both increasingly specialized within new and existing disciplines-science, engineering, social science, and medicine-and at the same time became further democratized, with new forms that make statistical, business, and government data more accessible to the public. At the close of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, an explosion in interactive digital data design has exponentially increased our access to data.  The contributors analyze this fascinating history through a variety of critical approaches, including visual rhetoric, visual culture, genre theory, and fully contextualized historical scholarship.},

  abstract = {High-speed flow research has been sponsored and performed at differing levels of effort since the late 1800s. For example, hypersonic research has experienced numerous cycles since the 1950s, with various periods of high research activity, followed by equally long periods of very low activity. This lack of continuity in high-speed flow research has led to a situation where researchers of one “generation” often do not know what the researchers of previous “generations” have done, mainly due to large losses of institutional knowledge in government, industry, and academic organizations. Therefore, a chronically weak area in research papers, reports, and reviews is the complete identification of critical background documents that form the building blocks and intellectual heritage for modern compressible flow research. A method for systematically determining these critical references is presented in the context of its application to high-speed flow using Citation-Assisted Background, which is based on the assumption that many critical documents tend to be highly cited within the literature, although not necessarily recently. While Citation-Assisted Background is a highly systematic approach for identifying critical references, it is not a substitute for the judgement of the researchers, but rather complements their expertise. In this critical review of high-speed compressible flow, important documents have been identified using Citation-Assisted Background, but other documents have been added by the authors to enhance the picture provided by the highly-cited documents.},

  abstract = {Transparency and peer control are cornerstones of good scientific practice and entail the replication and reproduction of findings. The feasibility of replications, however, hinges on the premise that original researchers make their data and research code publicly available. This applies in particular to large-N observational studies, where analysis code is complex and may involve several ambiguous analytical decisions. To investigate which specific factors influence researchers’ code sharing behavior upon request, we emailed code requests to 1,206 authors who published research articles based on data from the European Social Survey between 2015 and 2020. In this preregistered multifactorial field experiment, we randomly varied three aspects of our code request’s wording in a 2x4x2 factorial design: the overall framing of our request (enhancement of social science research, response to replication crisis), the appeal why researchers should share their code (FAIR principles, academic altruism, prospect of citation, no information), and the perceived effort associated with code sharing (no code cleaning required, no information). Overall, 37.5\% of successfully contacted authors supplied their analysis code. Of our experimental treatments, only framing affected researchers’ code sharing behavior, though in the opposite direction we expected: Scientists who received the negative wording alluding to the replication crisis were more likely to share their research code. Taken together, our results highlight that the availability of research code will hardly be enhanced by small-scale individual interventions but instead requires large-scale institutional norms.},

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues.                        ,                             Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008)               BMJ               337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

  abstract = {We distinguish diagrammatic from sentential paper-and-pencil representations of information by developing alternative models of information-processing systems that are informationally equivalent and that can be characterized as sentential or diagrammatic. Sentential representations are sequential, like the propositions in a text. Diagrammatic representations are indexed by location in a plane. Diagrammatic representations also typically display information that is only implicit in sentential representations and that therefore has to be computed, sometimes at great cost, to make it explicit for use. We then contrast the computational efficiency of these representations for solving several illustrative problems in mathematics and physics. When two representations are informationally equivalent, their computational efficiency depends on the information-processing operators that act on them. Two sets of operators may differ in their capabilities for recognizing patterns, in the inferences they can carry out directly, and in their control strategies (in particular, the control of search). Diagrammatic and sentential representations support operators that differ in all of these respects. Operators working on one representation may recognize features readily or make inferences directly that are difficult to realize in the other representation. Most important, however, are differences in the efficiency of search for information and in the explicitness of information. In the representations we call diagrammatic, information is organized by location, and often much of the information needed to make an inference is present and explicit at a single location. In addition, cues to the next logical step in the problem may be present at an adjacent location. Therefore problem solving can proceed through a smooth traversal of the diagram, and may require very little search or computation of elements that had been implicit.},

This study focuses on one of the most commonly used data collection techniques: web scraping. Going beyond canned approaches by leveraging a general framework of data communication, this study illustrates how online information can be systematically queried and fetched for reproducible research. To generalize our approaches, we additionally explore the variations in site security and architecture that analysts may encounter during the scraping process before they are given access to the desired data. The approaches we introduce do not rely on any proprietary software and can be easily implemented on any computing platform with programming languages such as Python or R. The methodological discussion in this study is meant to be applicable to current web-based research efforts. We include three examples with complete Python implementation. We also present an integrated workflow that enables researchers to produce analytical data sets that are traceable and thus verifiable for analysis or replication. Lastly, options related to the validity and efficiency of data are discussed, and we highlight the ongoing debate surrounding the ethics of online data collection, ultimately advocating for the fair use of online data.},

  abstract = {Technology driven changings with consecutive increase in the on-line availability and accessibility of journals and papers rapidly changes patterns of academic communication and publishing. The dissemination of important research findings through the academic and scientific community begins with publication in peer-reviewed journals. Aim of this article is to identify, critically evaluate and integrate the findings of relevant, high-quality individual studies addressing the trends of enhancement of visibility and accessibility of academic publishing in digital era. The number of citations a paper receives is often used as a measure of its impact and by extension, of its quality. Many aberrations of the citation practices have been reported in the attempt to increase impact of someone’s paper through manipulation with self-citation, inter-citation and citation cartels. Authors revenues to legally extend visibility, awareness and accessibility of their research outputs with uprising in citation and amplifying measurable personal scientist impact has strongly been enhanced by on line communication tools like networking (LinkedIn, Research Gate, Academia.edu, Google Scholar), sharing (Facebook, Blogs, Twitter, Google Plus) media sharing (Slide Share), data sharing (Dryad Digital Repository, Mendeley database, PubMed, PubChem), code sharing, impact tracking. Publishing in Open Access journals. Many studies and review articles in last decade have examined whether open access articles receive more citations than equivalent subscription toll access) articles and most of them lead to conclusion that there might be high probability that open access articles have the open access citation advantage over generally equivalent payfor-access articles in many, if not most disciplines. But it is still questionable are those never cited papers indeed “Worth(less) papers” and should journal impact factor and number of citations be considered as only suitable indicators to evaluate quality of scientists? “Publish or perish” phrase usually used to describe the pressure in academia to rapidly and continually publish academic work to sustain or further one’s career can now in 21. Century be reformulate into “Publish, be cited and maybe will not Perish”.           ,              Promjene pokretane tehnologijom koje posljedično dovode do uzastopnog povećanja on-line dostupnosti i pristupljivosti časopisima i znanstvenim radovima ubrzano mijenjaju obrasce akademske komunikacije i publiciranja. Širenje važnih otkrića u znanstvenoj zajednici počinje objavljivanjem u recenziranim časopisima. Svrha je ovoga članka prepoznati, kritički procijeniti i integrirati nalaze relevantnih, visokokvalitetnih individualnih studija koje se bave trendovima povećanja vidljivosti i pristupačnosti akademskoga izdavaštva u digitalnom dobu. Rezultati i diskusija: Broj citata koja pojedini znanstveni rad dobiva često se koristi kao mjera njegova utjecaja, a šire shvaćeno i njegove kvalitete. Zabilježene su mnoge aberacije u praksi citiranja kroz pokušaje povećanja utjecaja nečijega znanstvenoga rada manipuliranjem sa samocitiranjem, inter-citiranjem i udruživanjem u »citatne kartele«. Mogući putovi kojima bi autori mogli legalno povećati vidljivost i dostupnost svojih istraživačkih rezultata, s povećanjem broja citata i pojačavanjem mjerljivoga odjeka utjecaja, kako rada tako i znanstvenika, snažno su poboljšani on-line komunikacijskim alatima kao što su umrežavanje (LinkedIn, Research Gate, Academia.edu, Google Scholar), dijeljenje (Slide Share),dijeljenje podataka (Dryad Digital Repository, Mendeley database, PubMed, PubChem), dijeljenje koda, praćenje veličine utjecaja (Facebook, Blogovi, Twitter, Google Plus), te objavljivanjem u časopisima otvorenoga pristupa. Mnogi znanstveni i pregledni radovi u posljednjem desetljeću ispitali su hoće li se radovi objavljeni u časopisima s otvorenim pristupom više citirati u odnosu na radove objavljene u časopisima koji naplaćuju pristup, te većina rezultata upućuje na zaključak da bi mogla postojati komparativna prednost pri citiranju radova objavljenih uz otvoreni pristup u odnosu na drugu skupinu časopisa u mnogim, ako ne i u svim područjima znanosti. Ostaje upitno jesu li radovi koji ne budu nikad citirani doista i »bezvrijedni radovi«, te jesu li su faktor odjeka časopisa i broj citata doista jedini adekvatni indikatori za evaluaciju kvalitete znanstvenika? Zaključak: Frazu »Objavi ili nestani«, koju se obično koristi za opisivanje pritiska na članove akademske zajednice da brzo i neprekidno objavljuje znanstvene radove za održavanje ili napredak u daljnjoj karijeri, u 21. stoljeću se može preoblikovati u »Objavi i budi citiran, da možda ne bi nestao.«},

First, the elements of qualitative research are described and understood as an approach linked to the interpretation and meanings that are given to the world. Secondly, the functions and handling of the RQDA software are explained. The main feature of RQDA is the fact that it is a free and open-source cross-platform tool, which allows project administration for data management purposes. The results show that even with the limitations that this type of tool may have, they offer a series of advantages that make their use possible and desirable to develop quality social research. Regarding the conclusions section, a reflection is offered on the use of technology based on free software for social research purposes, which must consider the pros and cons during its implementation. Concepts such as that of open access, or free culture, incorporate various forms of attending to historical problems suffered by science and education.},

  abstract = {Knowledge about the software used in scientific investigations is necessary for different reasons, including provenance of the results, measuring software impact to attribute developers, and bibliometric software citation analysis in general. Additionally, providing information about whether and how the software and the source code are available allows an assessment about the state and role of open source software in science in general. While such analyses can be done manually, large scale analyses require the application of automated methods of information extraction and linking. In this paper, we present SoftwareKG—a knowledge graph that contains information about software mentions from more than 51,000 scientific articles from the social sciences. A silver standard corpus, created by a distant and weak supervision approach, and a gold standard corpus, created by manual annotation, were used to train an LSTM based neural network to identify software mentions in scientific articles. The model achieves a recognition rate of .82 F-score in exact matches. As a result, we identified more than 133,000 software mentions. For entity disambiguation, we used the public domain knowledge base DBpedia. Furthermore, we linked the entities of the knowledge graph to other knowledge bases such as the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph, the Software Ontology, and Wikidata. Finally, we illustrate, how SoftwareKG can be used to assess the role of software in the social sciences.},

  abstract = {The recent Facebook study about emotional contagion has generated a high-profile debate about the ethical and social issues in Big Data research. These issues are not unprecedented, but the debate highlighted that, in focusing on research ethics and the legal issues about this type of research, an important larger picture is overlooked about the extent to which free will is compatible with the growth of deterministic scientific knowledge, and how Big Data research has become central to this growth of knowledge. After discussing the ‘emotional contagion study’ as an illustration, these larger issues about Big Data and scientific knowledge are addressed by providing definitions of data, Big Data and of how scientific knowledge changes the human-made environment. Against this background, it will be possible to examine why the uses of data-driven analyses of human behaviour in particular have recently experienced rapid growth. The essay then goes on to discuss the distinction between basic scientific research as against applied research, a distinction which, it is argued, is necessary to understand the quite different implications in the context of scientific as opposed to applied research. Further, it is important to recognize that Big Data analyses are both enabled and constrained by the nature of data sources available. Big Data research is bound to become more widespread, and this will require more awareness on the part of data scientists, policymakers and a wider public about its contexts and often unintended consequences.},

A trend in F/OSS studies is the use of metadata stored in a repository of repositories or RoRs. This paper utilizes data obtained from such RoRs -FLOSSmole- to study the types of projects being developed by the F/OSS community. We downloaded projects by topics data in five areas (Database, Internet, Software Development, Communications, and Games/Entertainment) from Flossmole’s raw and summary data of the sourceforge repository. Time series analysis show the numbers of projects in the five topics are growing linearly. Further analysis supports our hypothesis that F/OSS development is moving “up the stack” from developer tools and infrastructure support to end-user applications such as Databases. The findings have implications for the interpretation of the F/OSS landscape, the utilization and adoption of open source databases, and problems researchers might face in obtaining and using data from RoRs.},

We consider merit as a social construction that structures the community as a whole by allocating prestige to its participants on the basis of what they do. It implies a hierarchy of the different activities (web maintenance, writing code, bug report...) within the project. We present a study based on the merging of two datasets. We analyze the archive of KDE mailing lists using a social network. We also use responses to a questionnaire of KDE participants. Results bring empirical evidences showing that this hierarchy structures the community of KDE by allocating more central position to participants with more prestigious activities. We also show that this hierarchy structures individuals participation by giving greater “membership esteem” to members involved in more prestigious activities.},

Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are visual representations of causal assumptions that are increasingly used in modern epidemiology. They can help to identify the presence of confounding for the causal question at hand. This structured approach serves as a visual aid in the scientific discussion by making underlying relations explicit. This article explains the basic concepts of DAGs and provides examples in the field of nephrology with and without presence of confounding. Ultimately, these examples will show that DAGs can be preferable to the traditional methods to identify sources of confounding, especially in complex research questions.},

Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the “scatterplot”) and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson’s grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical “poems.” Supplemental materials are available online.},

There is increasing awareness and interest in the scientific community about the benefits offered by free and open source software. We discuss the present state of scientific publishing and the merits of advocating for a wider adoption of open standards in science, particularly where it concerns the publishing process.},

  abstract = {Twitter is an important object of research in social science studies, and the emergence of numerous Twitter software tools has provided researchers with the possibility of gaining insights into Twitter data; however, at the same time, early stage researchers may experience difficulties in selecting the most suitable tool for their own projects. Due to personal or institutional financial constraints, the purchase of commercial software is not a wise investment for all researchers. Hence, this article aims to provide a review of nine different free-of-charge and low-cost software tools for studying Twitter and highlights their advantages and disadvantages, in order to serve as a guide for social science scholars. This review is divided into two parts: background information and data retrieval features of the software tools, and their data analysis features. At the end of the review, several recommendations and suggestions are made for the use of these tools.},

  abstract = {Citation is considered as an essential part in any academic writing whereby it is one way for writers to support any claims or arguments made in their study with literature from previous research. Literature review is known as a chapter which provides background for research described in a thesis. However, relatively not many studies are done on literature review chapter of thesis which may be due to the extensive nature of the text. Writing academic texts such as a thesis requires an author to acknowledge other researchers’ work through proper use of citations. Learning the appropriate way to cite is important in any kinds of academic writing especially among research students who are writing their theses. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate the citation practices in doctoral theses of Chemical Engineering. The purpose of this study is two folds; i) to identify the types of citations used in the corpus (using Swale's 1990 categorization) and ii) to examine the functions related to the citations used (using Thompson's 2001 framework). Three literature review chapters were analysed first to identify the types of citations used in the mini corpus and the functions related to the citations. The results of the study show that engineering student writers mostly used Non-integral citations as compared to Integral. The study concludes with a discussion on the skills of citing the literature which should be given more attention to raise the awareness level among students.},
