Four themes
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item “establish a shared framework that allows quantitative and qualitative scholars to assess more effectively, and communicate about, issues of valid measurement” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 529)
\item “draw a clear distinction between measurement issues and disputes about concepts” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 529)
\item “contextual specificity of measurement claims, exploring a variety of measurement strategies that seek to combine generality and validity by devoting greater attention to context” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 529)
\item “address the proliferation of terms for alternative measurement validation procedures and offer an account of the three main types of validation most relevant to political scientists.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 529)

\end{enumerate}

\par
“Do the observations meaningfully capture the ideas contained in the concepts?” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 529)
\par
“Measurement validity is specifically concerned with whether operationalization and the scoring of cases adequately reflect the concept the researcher seeks to measure.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 529)
\par
“examples are drawn from recent comparative work on democracy” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 529)
\par
\section{OVERVIEW OF MEASUREMENT VALIDITY}

\par
“Measurement validity should be understood in relation to issues that arise in moving between concepts and observations.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 530)
\par
\subsection{Levels and Tasks}

\par
“At the third level are indicators, which are also routinely called measures. This level includes any systematic scoring procedure, ranging from simple measures to complex aggregated indexes.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 530)
\par
“At the fourth level are scores for cases, which include both numerical scores and the results of qualitative classification.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 530)
\par
“On the left-hand side, conceptualization is the movement from the background concept to the systematized concept.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 530)
\par
“Moving up on the righthand side, indicators may be refined in light of scores, and systematized concepts may be fine-tuned in light of knowledge about scores and indicators.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 530)
\par
\subsection{Defining Measurement Validity}

\par
“Valid measurement is achieved when scores (including the results of qualitative classification) meaningfully capture the ideas contained in the corresponding concept.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 530)
\par
“At the concept end, our basic point (explored in detail below) is that measurement validation should focus on the” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 530)
\par
“relation between observations and the systematized concept; any potential disputes about the background concept should be set aside as an important but separate issue. With regard to scores, an obvious but crucial point must be stressed: Scores are never examined in isolation; rather, they are interpreted and given meaning in relation to the systematized concept” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 531)
\par
“In sum, measurement is valid when the scores (level 4 in Figure 1), derived from a given indicator (level 3), can meaningfully be interpreted in terms of the systematized concept (level 2) that the indicator seeks to operationalize.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 531)
\par
\subsection{Measurement Error, Reliability, and Validity}

\par
“Random error, which occurs when repeated applications of a given measurement procedure yield inconsistent results, is conventionally labeled a problem of reliability.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 531)
\par
“Methodologists offer two accounts of the relation between reliability and validity. (1) Validity is sometimes understood as exclusively involving bias, that is error that takes a consistent direction or form. From this perspective, validity involves systematic error, whereas reliability involves random error” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 531)
\par
(Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 531) Print this... put as background or something.
\par
“(2) Alternatively, some scholars hesitate to view scores as valid if they contain large amounts of random error.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 532)
\par
“Our goal is not to adjudicate between these accounts but to state them clearly and to specify our own focus, namely, the systematic error that arises when the links among systematized concepts, indicators, and scores are poorly developed. This involves validity in the first sense stated above.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 532)
\par
“Because error is a pervasive threat to measurement, it is essential to view the interpretations of scores in relation to systematized concepts as falsifiable claims (Messick 1989, 13– 4). Scholars should treat these claims just as they would any casual hypothesis, that is, as tentative statements that require supporting evidence. Validity assessment is the search for this evidence.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 532)
\par
\section{MEASUREMENT VALIDITY AND CHOICES ABOUT CONCEPTS}

\subsection{Conceptual Choices: Forming the Systematized Concept}

\par
“We view systematized concepts as the point of departure for assessing measurement validity. How do scholars form such concepts? Because background concepts routinely include a variety of meanings, the formation of systematized concepts often involves choosing among them.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 532)
\par
“Rather than make sweeping claims about what the background concept “really” means, scholars should present specific arguments, linked to the goals and context of their research, that justify their particular choices.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 532)
\par
“A third problem occurs when scholars stop short of providing a fleshed-out account of their systematized concepts. This requires not just a one-sentence definition, but a broader specification of the meaning and entailments of the systematized concept. Within the psychometrics literature, Shepard (1993, 417) summarizes what is required: “both an internal model of interrelated dimensions or subdomains” of the systematized concept, and “an external model depicting its relationship to other [concepts].”” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 532)
\par
“One consequence of this effort to provide a fleshedout account may be the recognition that the concept needs to be disaggregated.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 533)
\par
\subsection{Measurement Validity and the Systematized Versus Background Concept}

\par
“We stated earlier that the systematized concept, rather than the background concept, should be the focus in measurement validation.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 533)
\par
“Scholars who question Mexico’s score should distinguish two issues: (1) a concern about measurement—whether the indicator employed produces scores that can be interpreted as adequately capturing the systematized concept used in a given study and (2) a conceptual concern—whether the systematized concept employed in creating the indicator is appropriate vis-a `-vis the background concept of democracy. We believe validation should focus on the first issue, whereas the second is outside the realm of measurement validity.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 533)
\par
“The more complex and contested the background concept, the more important it is to distinguish issues of measurement from fundamental conceptual disputes. To pose the question of validity we need a specific conceptual referent against which to assess the adequacy of a given measure. A systematized concept provides that referent.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 533)
\par
\subsection{Fine-Tuning the Systematized Concept with Friendly Amendments}

\par
“We define measurement validity as concerned with the relation among scores, indicators, and the systematized concept, but we do not rule out the introduction of new conceptual ideas during the validation process.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 533)
\par
\section{VALIDITY, CONTEXTUAL SPECIFICITY, AND EQUIVALENCE}

\par
“Contextual specificity is a fundamental concern that arises when differences in context potentially threaten the validity of measurement. This is a central topic in psychometrics, the field that has produced the most innovative work on validity theory. This literature emphasizes that the same score on an indicator may have different meanings in different contexts (Moss 1992, 236 – 8; see also Messick 1989, 15).” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 534)
\par
“In political science, this concern with context can arise when scholars are making comparisons across different world regions or distinct historical periods.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 534)
\par
“We are not arguing that the quest for generality be abandoned. Rather, we believe greater sensitivity to context may help scholars develop measures that can be validly applied across diverse contexts.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 534)
\par
\subsection{Contextual Specificity in Political Research}

\par
“Contextual specificity affects many areas of political science. It has long been a problem in cross-national survey research” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 534)
\par
“scholars debate whether a given survey item has the same meaning for different population subgroups—which could be defined, for example, by region, gender, class, or race. One specific concern is whether population subgroups differ systematically in their “response style” (also called “response sets”). Some groups may be more disposed to give extreme answers, and others may tend toward moderate answers (Greenleaf 1992)” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 534)
\par
“Any empirical assessment of measurement validity is necessarily based on a particular set of cases, and validity claims should be made, at least initially, with reference to this specific set. To the extent that the set is heterogeneous in ways that may affect measurement validity, it is essential to (1) assess the implications for establishing equivalence across these diverse contexts and, if necessary, (2) adopt context-sensitive measures.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 535)
\par
\subsection{Establishing Equivalence: Context-Specific Domains of Observation}

\par
“One important means of establishing equivalence across diverse contexts is careful reasoning, in the initial stages of operationalization, about the specific domains to which a systematized concept applies. Well before thinking about particular scoring procedures, scholars may need to make context-sensitive choices regarding the parts of the broader polity, economy, or society to which they will apply their concept. Equivalent observations may require, in different contexts, a focus on what at a concrete level might be seen as distinct types of phenomena.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 535) Context-specific... like EN WP vs smaller languages like RU and UK
\par
\subsection{Establishing Equivalence: Context-Specific Indicators and Adjusted Common Indicators}

\par
“Two other ways of establishing equivalence involve careful work at the level of indicators. We will discuss \textbf{context-specific indicators}, and what we call \textbf{adjusted common indicators}. In this second approach, the same indicator is applied to all cases but is weighted to compensate for contextual differences.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 535)
\par
“For all the countries, they analyze four relatively standard attributes of participation. Regarding a fifth attribute—membership in a political party—they observe that in four of the countries party membership has a roughly equivalent meaning, but in the United States it has a different form and meaning. The authors conclude that involvement in U.S. electoral campaigns reflects an equivalent form of political participation.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 535)
\par
“Specifically, the overall index for the United States includes a measure of campaign participation rather than party membership.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 535)
\par
“Thus, a different scoring procedure—a context-specific indicator—is employed in each period in order to produce scores that are comparable with respect to this systematized concept.5” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 536)
\par
“Because U.S. policy is distinctive, the authors multiply health care expenditures in the other countries by a coefficient that lowers their scores on this variable. Their scores are thereby made roughly equivalent—as part of a measure of public expenditures on individuals outside the labor force—to the U.S. score.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 536)
\par
“Context-specific indicators and adjusted common indicators are not always a step forward, and some scholars have self-consciously avoided them. The use of such indicators should match the analytic goal of the researcher.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 536)
\par
“Thus, for certain purposes, it can be analytically productive to adopt a standard definition that ignores nuances of context and apply the same indicator to all cases.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 536)
\par
“We have identified three tools context-specific domains of observation, context-specific indicators, and adjusted common indicators—for addressing these issues, and we encourage their wider use. We also advocate greater attention to justifying their use. Claims about the appropriateness of contextual adjustments should not simply be asserted; their validity needs to be carefully defended.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 536)
\par
\section{ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVES ON TYPES OF VALIDATION}

\subsection{Evolving Understandings of Validity}

\par
“We have adopted measurement validity as the name for the overall topic of this article” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 537)
\par
“We find it helpful to group these procedures into two types according to the kind of theoretical or conceptual relationship that serves as the point of reference. Specifically, these types are based on the heuristic distinction between description and explanation.7 First, some procedures rely on “descriptive” expectations concerning whether given attributes are understood as facets of the same phenomenon. This is the focus of what we label “convergent/discriminant validation.” Second, other procedures rely on relatively well-established “explanatory” causal relations as a baseline against which measurement validity is assessed. In labeling this second group of procedures we draw on Campbell’s (1960, 547) helpful term, “nomological” validation, which evokes the idea of assessment in relation to well-established causal hypotheses or lawlike relationships. This second type is often called construct validity in political research (Berry et al. 1998; Elkins 2000).8 Out of deference to this usage, in the headings and summary statements below we will refer to nomological/construct validation.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 537)
\par
\section{THREE TYPES OF MEASUREMENT VALIDATION: QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE EXAMPLES}

\par
“We organize our presentation in terms of a threefold typology: content, convergent/discriminant, and nomological/construct validation.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 538)
\par
\subsection{Content Validation}

\par
“In the framework of Figure 1, does a given indicator (level 3) adequately capture the full content of the systematized concept (level 2)?” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 538)
\par
“are key elements omitted from the indicator?” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 538)
\par
“are inappropriate elements included in the indicator?” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 538)
\par
“content validation is distinctive in its focus on conceptual issues, specifically, on what we have just called adequacy of content.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 538)
\par
“Within the psychometric tradition (Angoff 1988, 27– 8; Shultz, Riggs, and Kottke 1998, 267– 8), content validation is understood as focusing on the relationship between the indicator (level 3) and the systematized concept (level 2), without reference to the scores of specific cases (level 4).” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 539)
\par
“In the vocabulary of Sartori (1970, 1040 – 6), this concerns the relation between the “intension” (meaning) and “extension” (set of positive cases) of the concept. For Sartori, an essential aspect of concept formation is the procedure of adjusting this relation between cases and” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 539)
\par
“concept. In the framework of Figure 1, this procedure involves revising the indicator (i.e., the scoring procedure) in order to sort cases in a way that better fits conceptual expectations, and potentially fine-tuning the systematized concept to better fit the cases. Ragin (1994, 98) terms this process of mutual adjustment “double fitting.” This procedure avoids conceptual stretching (Collier and Mahon 1993; Sartori 1970), that is, a mismatch between a systematized concept and the scoring of cases, which is clearly an issue of validity.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 539)
\par
“In sum, for case-oriented content validation, upward movement in Figure 1 is especially important. It can lead to both refining the indicator in light of scores and fine-tuning the systematized concept. In addition, although the systematized concept being measured is usually relatively stable, this form of validation may lead to friendly amendments that modify the systematized concept by drawing ideas from the background concept. To put this another way, in this form of validation both an “inductive” component and conceptual innovation are especially important.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 539)
\par
“although a necessary condition, the findings of content validation are not a sufficient condition for establishing validity” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 539)
\par
“It is useful to complement the conceptual criticism of indicators by examining whether particular modifications in an indicator make a difference in the scoring of cases. To the extent that such modifications have little influence on scores, their contribution to improving validity is more modest.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 539)
\par
\subsection{Convergent/Discriminant Validation}

\par
“Are the scores (level 4) produced by alternative indicators (level 3) of a given systematized concept (level 2) empirically associated and thus convergent?” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 540)
\par
“do these indicators have a weaker association with indicators of a second, different systematized concept, thus discriminating this second group of indicators from the first? Stronger associations constitute evidence that supports interpreting indicators as measuring the same systematized concept—thus providing convergent validation; whereas weaker associations support the claim that they measure different concepts—thus providing discriminant validation.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 540)
\par
“The special case of convergent validation in which one indicator is taken as a standard of reference, and is used to evaluate one or more alternative indicators, is called criterion validation” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 540)
\par
“Thus, analysts who create a new indicator commonly report its correlation with previously established indicators” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 540)
\par
“Scholars should have specific conceptual reasons for expecting convergence if it is to constitute evidence for validity. Let us suppose a proposed indicator is meant to capture a facet of democracy overlooked by existing measures; then too high a correlation is in fact negative evidence regarding validity, for it suggests that nothing new is being captured.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 540)
\par
“Convergent/discriminant validation is also employed when qualitative researchers use a multimethod approach involving “triangulation” among multiple indicators based on different kinds of data sources” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 540) The article on WP Ukraine does triangulation
\par
“Another concern arises over the interpretation of low correlations among indicators. Analysts who lack a “true” measure against which to assess validity must base convergent validation on a set of indicators, none of which may be a very good measure of the systematized concept. The result may be low correlations among indicators, even though they have shared variance that measures the concept. One possible solution is to focus on this shared variance, even though the overall correlations are low. Standard statistical techniques may be used to tap this shared variance.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 541)
\par
“The opposite problem also is a concern: the limitations of inferring validity from a high correlation among indicators. Such a correlation may reflect factors other than valid measurement. For example, two indicators may be strongly correlated because they both measure some other concept; or they may measure different concepts, one of which causes the other. A plausible response is to think through, and seek to rule out, alternative reasons for the high correlation.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 541)
\par
“Convergent Validation and Structural Equation Models with Latent Variables.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 541)
\par
“He demonstrates, for example, its distinctive contribution for a scholar concerned with convergent/discriminant validation who is dealing with a data set with high correlations among alternative indicators. In this case, structural equations with latent variables can be used to estimate the degree to which these high correlations derive from shared systematic bias, rather than reflect the valid measurement of an underlying concept.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 541)
\par
“complex quantitative techniques cannot replace careful conceptual and theoretical reasoning; rather they presuppose it.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 541)
\par
\subsection{Nomological/Construct Validation}

\par
“In a domain of research in which a given causal hypothesis is reasonably well established, we ask: Is this hypothesis again confirmed when the cases are scored (level 4) with the proposed indicator (level 3) for a systematized concept (level 2) that is one of the variables in the hypothesis? Confirmation is treated as evidence for validity.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 542)
\par
“We also propose an acronym that vividly captures the underlying idea: AHEM validation; that is, “Assume the Hypothesis, Evaluate the Measure.”” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 542)
\par
“Nomological validation assesses the performance of indicators in relation to causal hypotheses in order to gain leverage in evaluating measurement validity. Whereas convergent validation focuses on multiple indicators of the same systematized concept, and discriminant validation focuses on indicators of different concepts that stand in a “descriptive” relation to one another, nomological validation focuses on indicators of different concepts that are understood to stand in an explanatory, “causal” relation with one another.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 542)
\par
“In practice the contrast between description and explanation depends on the researcher’s theoretical framework, but the distinction is fundamental to the contemporary practice of political science.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 542)
\par
“The underlying idea of nomological validation is that scores which can validly be claimed to measure a systematized concept should fit well-established expectations derived from causal hypotheses that involve this concept. The first step is to take as given a reasonably well-established causal hypothesis, one variable in which corresponds to the systematized concept of concern. The scholar then examines the association of the proposed indicator with indicators of the other concepts in the causal hypothesis. If the assessment produces an association that the causal hypothesis leads us to expect, then this is positive evidence for validity.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 542)
\par
“When other approaches yield positive evidence, however, then nomological validation is valuable in teasing out potentially important differences that may not be detected by other types of validation.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 542)
\par
“any subsequent hypothesis-testing should involve hypotheses different from those used in nomological validation.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 543)
\par
““We are like sailors who must repair a rotting ship at sea. We trust the great bulk of the timbers while we replace a particularly weak plank. Each of the timbers we now trust we may in turn replace. The proportion of the planks we are replacing to those we treat as sound must always be small.”” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 543)

\section{VALIDITY, CONTEXTUAL SPECIFICITY, AND EQUIVALENCE}

\par
\textbf{Contextual specificity:} “the same score on an indicator may have different meanings in different contexts (Moss 1992, 236 – 8; see also Messick 1989, 15).” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 534)
\par
“Any empirical assessment of measurement validity is necessarily based on a particular set of cases, and validity claims should be made, at least initially, with reference to this specific set. To the extent that the set is heterogeneous in ways that may affect measurement validity, it is essential to (1) assess the implications for establishing equivalence across these diverse contexts and, if necessary, (2) adopt context-sensitive measures.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 535)
\par
\subsection{Establishing Equivalence: Context-Specific Domains of Observation}

\par
During early steps of operationalisation, consider whether the domain of observation of the systemized concept is appropriate for the context.
\par
Example:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Systemized concept: political participation
\item Attribute: membership to political party
\item Context-specific domain: in US context, changed domain from membership to campaign participation

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Establishing Equivalence: Context-Specific Indicators and Adjusted Common Indicators}

\par
\textbf{Context-specific indicators}
\par
Examples
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Different indicator per time period

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Adjusted common indicators:} “the same indicator is applied to all cases but is weighted to compensate for contextual differences.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 535)

For Sartori, an essential aspect of concept formation is the procedure of adjusting this relation between cases and concept. In the framework of Figure 1, this procedure involves revising the indicator (i.e., the scoring procedure) in order to sort cases in a way that better fits conceptual expectations, and potentially fine-tuning the systematized concept to better fit the cases. Ragin (1994, 98) terms this process of mutual adjustment “double fitting.” This procedure avoids conceptual stretching (Collier and Mahon 1993; Sartori 1970), that is, a mismatch between a systematized concept and the scoring of cases, which is clearly an issue of validity.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, page 538-539)

“Are the scores (level 4) produced by alternative indicators (level 3) of a given systematized concept (level 2) empirically associated and thus convergent?” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 540)
\par
\subsection{Nomological/Construct Validation}

\par
“In a domain of research in which a given causal hypothesis is reasonably well established, we ask: Is this hypothesis again confirmed when the cases are scored (level 4) with the proposed indicator (level 3) for a systematized concept (level 2) that is one of the variables in the hypothesis? Confirmation is treated as evidence for validity.” (Adcock and Collier, 2001, p. 542)

This is partly due to residual difficulties in performing and documenting the selection process of open source solutions. In this paper we describe the FOCSE metrics framework, supporting a specific selection process for security-related open source code. FOCSE is based on a set of general purpose metrics suitable for evaluating open source frameworks in general; however, it includes some specific metrics expressing security solutions’ capability of responding to continuous change in threats. We show FOCSE at work in two use cases about selecting two different types of security-related open source solutions, i.e. Single Sign-On and Secure Shell applications.},

  abstract = {modelsummary is a package to summarize data and statistical models in R. It supports over one hundred types of models out-of-the-box, and allows users to report the results of those models side-by-side in a table, or in coefficient plots. It makes it easy to execute common tasks such as computing robust standard errors, adding significance stars, and manipulating coefficient and model labels. Beyond model summaries, the package also includes a suite of tools to produce highly flexible data summary tables, such as dataset overviews, correlation matrices, (multi-level) cross-tabulations, and balance tables (also known as "Table 1"). The appearance of the tables produced by modelsummary can be customized using external packages such as kableExtra, gt, flextable, or huxtable; the plots can be customized using ggplot2. Tables can be exported to many output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, Text/Markdown, Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, RTF, PDF, and image files. Tables and plots can be embedded seamlessly in rmarkdown, knitr, or Sweave dynamic documents. The modelsummary package is designed to be simple, robust, modular, and extensible.},

We distinguish between different types of scoping studies and indicate where these stand in relation to full systematic reviews. We outline a framework for conducting a scoping study based on our recent experiences of reviewing the literature on services for carers for people with mental health problems. Where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users. Finally, we consider the advantages and limitations of the approach and suggest that a wider debate is called for about the role of the scoping study in relation to other types of literature reviews.},

The success of a project is often related to the number of developers it can attract: a larger community of developers (the ‘bazaar’) identifies and corrects more software defects and adds more features via a peer-review process. In this paper two free software projects (Wine and Arla) are empirically explored in order to characterize their software lifecycle, development processes and communities. Both the projects show a phase where the number of active developers and the actual work performed on the system is constant, or does not grow: we argued that this phase corresponds to the one termed ‘cathedral’ in the literature. One of the two projects (Wine) shows also a second phase: a sudden growing amount of developers corresponds to a similar growing output produced: we termed this as the ‘bazaar’ phase, and we also argued that this phase was not achieved for the other system. A further analysis revealed that the transition between ‘cathedral’ and ‘bazaar’ was a phase by itself in Wine, achieved by creating a growing amount of new modules, which attracted new developers.},

Unfortunately, accessing publications from many reputed journals comes at a high cost—a cost that many researchers and institutions cannot afford. Although, openaccess publication model is considered by many as a possible route to ensure that science is free for all; however, it is fraught with its own challenges. This review attempts at exploring the possibilities of keeping science accessible. Firstly, we re-visit the meaning of “open science” as a comprehensive concept which includes open source, data, access, resources, peer review etc. and not merely open access publication model. Next, we have discussed the global initiatives towards open access—the Budapest Open Access Initiative, Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing, Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities, cOAlition S and its Plan S initiative, UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science and the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). Following this we have included the various open access initiatives from India. In the next part, we have focused on problems with dissemination of scientific outcomes and the challenges associated with existing publication models. Finally, we explore the possible solutions to the existing challenges, which include promotion of pre-print servers and other ideas that we have detailed in the manuscript.},

Picturing, Rotation, Isolation, and Masking up to nine dimensions (PRIM-9) was part of John Tukey's body of research in exploratory data analysis that foreshadowed today's data mining research. Linking was not a feature for PRIM-9, because linking is used when there are multiple plots visible, a style that emerged a decade beyond PRIM-9's days. Tours provide sequences of low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional data. The PRIM-9 video is piece of theatre— staged, scripted, and substantive.},

Public administrations around the world have also embraced FOSS as a way to reduce costs or assert their sovereignty, and many social activists use it to develop autonomous infrastructures.

Arguing for a material, not divine, origin of species, he showed that new species are achieved by 'natural selection'. Development, diversification, decay, extinction and absence of plan are all inherent to his theories." "Darwin read prodigiously across many fields; he reflected on his experiences as a traveler, he experimented. His profoundly influential concept of 'natural selection' condenses materials from past and present, from the Galapagos Islands to rural Staffordshire, from English back gardens to colonial encounters. The Origin communicates the enthusiasm of original thinking in an open, descriptive style, and Darwin's emphasis on the value of diversity speaks more strongly now than ever."--The publisher's description}

Our aim is to explore the intersection between FOSS and computational reproducibility. We begin by situating FOSS in relation to other ‘open’ initiatives, and specifically open science, open research, and open scholarship. In this context, we argue that anyone who actively contributes to the research process today is a computational researcher, in that they use computers to manage and store information. We then provide a primer to FOSS suitable for anyone concerned with research quality and sustainability—including researchers in any field, as well as support staff, administrators, publishers, funders, and so on. Next, we illustrate how the notions introduced in the primer apply to resources for scientific computing, with reference to the GNU Scientific Library as a case study. We conclude by discussing why the common interpretation of ‘open source’ as ‘open code’ is misplaced, and we use this example to articulate the role of FOSS in research and scholarship today. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Reliability and reproducibility in computational science: implementing verification, validation and uncertainty quantification in silico’.},

  abstract = {Open Access (OA) is an evolving publication model that is heavily supported by politics and science organizations aiming to make scientific knowledge more accessible to a wider audience. Whether it will indeed alter scholarly communication, however, depends on researchers’ underlying attitudes, motivations, and needs. Drawing on group discussions and interviews (n = 42), this study explores the perceptions, attitudes and behaviours of researchers towards OA publishing. We focus on researchers in the field of biomedical and health informatics located in different global regions and from different seniority levels. Overall, the results show that whilst most researchers support the idea of making scientific knowledge freely accessible to everyone, they are hesitant about actually living this practice by choosing OA journals to publish their own work. Article processing charges and quality issues are perceived as the main obstacles in this respect, revealing a two-sided evaluation of OA models, reflecting the different viewpoints of researchers as authors or readers. The results further highlight hitherto underexplored influencing factors regarding institutional frame conditions, located on the level of the scientific system, the publication service providers or the national/international OA policies.},

Here we examine breakthroughs over the past decade that include self-supervised learning, which allows models to be trained on vast amounts of unlabelled data, and geometric deep learning, which leverages knowledge about the structure of scientific data to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Generative AI methods can create designs, such as small-molecule drugs and proteins, by analysing diverse data modalities, including images and sequences. We discuss how these methods can help scientists throughout the scientific process and the central issues that remain despite such advances. Both developers and users of AI toolsneed a better understanding of when such approaches need improvement, and challenges posed by poor data quality and stewardship remain. These issues cut across scientific disciplines and require developing foundational algorithmic approaches that can contribute to scientific understanding or acquire it autonomously, making them critical areas of focus for AI innovation.},

Multiple factors, including the open science movement, national funding, and progress in information technology, have fueled its development. Such related tools as materials databases, machine learning, and high-throughput methods are now established as parts of the materials research toolset. However, there are a variety of challenges that impede progress in data-driven materials science: data veracity, integration of experimental and computational data, data longevity, standardization, and the gap between industrial interests and academic efforts. In this perspective article, the historical development and current state of data-driven materials science, building from the early evolution of open science to the rapid expansion of materials data infrastructures are discussed.

However, data visualization exposes a large space of visual configurations depending on the type of data to be visualized, the different displays (e.g., scatter plots, line graphs, pie charts), the visual components to encode the data (e.g., lines, dots, bars), or the specific visual attributes of those components (e.g., color, shape, size, length). Researchers and developers are not usually aware about best practices in data visualization, and they are required to learn about both the design practices that make communication effective and the low level details of the specific software tool used to generate the visualization. This paper proposes a software product line approach to model and materialize the variability of the visualization design process, guided by feature models. We encode the visualization knowledge regarding the best design practices, resolve the variability following a step-wise configuration approach, and then evaluate our proposal for a specific software visualization tool. Our solution helps researchers and developers communicate their quantitative results effectively by assisting them in the selection and generation of the visualizations that work best for each case. We open a new window of research where data visualization and variability meet each other.},

  abstract = {Background: Reflection is well established as an important part of teacher education, but it is also the focus of critical enquiry. This means that reflection is of interest to those who wish to explore its use to produce ‘better’ teachers. It is also of interest to scholars who are interested in the wider implications of reflection, for example, in relation to power and social control. Academic articles are the primary medium through which ideas and practices are communicated. However, they can only contribute if they are accepted for publication on the basis of making a contribution to knowledge. To be seen in this way, a journal paper needs to cite earlier work to show understanding of this work and how this is being augmented. Purpose: This paper aims to initiate an academic debate of citation practices which, it argues, should be based on an awareness of current practices and a willingness to share, and even change, them. To facilitate the debate and the development of a better understanding of citing and its implications, the paper offers a tripartite citation framework. Sources of evidence: The extensive citation analysis literature is reviewed to provide a context for an examination of the variety of citation practices found in 24 papers, which all focus on initial teacher education and which cite the same critical paper (Fendler, L., Teacher reflection in a hall of mirrors: Historical influences and political reverberations. Educational Researcher, 32, no. 3: 16–25, 2003; doi: 10.3102/0013189X032003016). Main argument: This paper argues that there is value in differentiating three categories of citation, labelled ‘cameo’, ‘supporting role’ and ‘star’. These categories do not make judgements about what counts as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ referencing. Rather, they provide a way for authors to assess how they are citing and what the possible consequences may be. These can include an apparent lack of understanding not just of a cited paper but also of the wider literature. This means that citation that is not being carefully managed can undermine an argument. Conclusions: This paper concludes that there is there is a need to initiate an academic debate about citation which is premised on the development of self-awareness about current practice and its consequences. Such a debate could bring about a number of benefits. It would encourage individual scholars to develop self-aware and ethical citation; it would also clarify current expectations about citation and enable academic communities to reflect on whether enquiry is well served by them.},

Yet in computational hydrology the code and data that actually produces published results are not regularly made available, inhibiting the ability of the community to reproduce and verify previous findings. In order to overcome this problem we recommend that reuseable code and formal workflows, which unambiguously reproduce published scientific results, are made available for the community alongside data, so that we can verify previous findings, and build directly from previous work. In cases where reproducing large-scale hydrologic studies is computationally very expensive and time-consuming, new processes are required to ensure scientific rigor. Such changes will strongly improve the transparency of hydrological research, and thus provide a more credible foundation for scientific advancement and policy support.},

Our account delineates the key role that actors play in shaping the identity of a niche, amplifying its presence, and finally mainstreaming it. We observe a heterogenous response by incumbents to the emergent niche and highlight the sustained coexistence of a niche and regime as a distinct form of technological transition. Finally, we demonstrate the significant impact that a niche can have, spanning beyond the targeted regime, and becoming part of the landscape. Our insights highlight how tracing the processes involved in the emergence and development of a niche can provide a prospective and generative understanding of technological transition, thereby contributing to and complementing the extant SNM and MLP literatures.},

In this manuscript, we assess code sharing and model documentation practices of 7500 publications about individual-based and agent-based models. The code availability increased over the years, up to 18\% in 2018. Model documentation does not include all the elements that could improve the transparency of the models, such as mathematical equations, flow charts, and pseudocode. We find that articles with equations and flow charts being cited more among other model papers, probably because the model documentation is more transparent. The practices of code sharing improve slowly over time, partly due to the emergence of more public repositories and archives, and code availability requirements by journals and sponsors. However, a significant change in norms and habits need to happen before computational modeling becomes a reproducible science.},

Kelty investigates the history and cultural significance of Free Software, revealing the people and practices that have transformed not only software but also music, film, science, and education. Free Software is a set of practices devoted to the collaborative creation of software source code that is made openly and freely available through an unconventional use of copyright law. Kelty explains how these specific practices have reoriented the relations of power around the creation, dissemination, and authorization of all kinds of knowledge. He also makes an important contribution to discussions of public spheres and social imaginaries by demonstrating how Free Software is a "recursive public"--a public organized around the ability to build, modify, and maintain the very infrastructure that gives it life in the first place. Drawing on ethnographic research that took him from an Internet healthcare start-up company in Boston to media labs in Berlin to young entrepreneurs in Bangalore, Kelty describes the technologies and the moral vision that bind together hackers, geeks, lawyers, and other Free Software advocates. In each case, he shows how their practices and way of life include not only the sharing of software source code but also ways of conceptualizing openness, writing copyright licenses, coordinating collaboration, and proselytizing. By exploring in detail how these practices came together as the Free Software movement from the 1970s to the 1990s, Kelty also considers how it is possible to understand the new movements emerging from Free Software: projects such as Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that creates copyright licenses, and Connexions, a project to create an online scholarly textbook commons.},

Using a data set of 30 open source project retrieved from SourceForge.net, we demonstrate the application of DEA, showing that the efficiency of the projects is in general relatively high.

Today, we are used to seeing data portrayed in a dizzying array of graphic forms. Virtually any quantified knowledge, from social and physical science to engineering and medicine, as well as business, government, or personal activity, has been visualized. Yet the methods of making data visible are relatively new innovations, most stemming from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century innovations that arose as a logical response to a growing desire to quantify everything-from science, economics, and industry to population, health, and crime. Innovators such as Playfair, Alexander von Humboldt, Heinrich Berghaus, John Snow, Florence Nightingale, Francis Galton, and Charles Minard began to develop graphical methods to make data and their relations more visible. In the twentieth century, data design became both increasingly specialized within new and existing disciplines-science, engineering, social science, and medicine-and at the same time became further democratized, with new forms that make statistical, business, and government data more accessible to the public. At the close of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, an explosion in interactive digital data design has exponentially increased our access to data.  The contributors analyze this fascinating history through a variety of critical approaches, including visual rhetoric, visual culture, genre theory, and fully contextualized historical scholarship.},

  abstract = {High-speed flow research has been sponsored and performed at differing levels of effort since the late 1800s. For example, hypersonic research has experienced numerous cycles since the 1950s, with various periods of high research activity, followed by equally long periods of very low activity. This lack of continuity in high-speed flow research has led to a situation where researchers of one “generation” often do not know what the researchers of previous “generations” have done, mainly due to large losses of institutional knowledge in government, industry, and academic organizations. Therefore, a chronically weak area in research papers, reports, and reviews is the complete identification of critical background documents that form the building blocks and intellectual heritage for modern compressible flow research. A method for systematically determining these critical references is presented in the context of its application to high-speed flow using Citation-Assisted Background, which is based on the assumption that many critical documents tend to be highly cited within the literature, although not necessarily recently. While Citation-Assisted Background is a highly systematic approach for identifying critical references, it is not a substitute for the judgement of the researchers, but rather complements their expertise. In this critical review of high-speed compressible flow, important documents have been identified using Citation-Assisted Background, but other documents have been added by the authors to enhance the picture provided by the highly-cited documents.},

  abstract = {Transparency and peer control are cornerstones of good scientific practice and entail the replication and reproduction of findings. The feasibility of replications, however, hinges on the premise that original researchers make their data and research code publicly available. This applies in particular to large-N observational studies, where analysis code is complex and may involve several ambiguous analytical decisions. To investigate which specific factors influence researchers’ code sharing behavior upon request, we emailed code requests to 1,206 authors who published research articles based on data from the European Social Survey between 2015 and 2020. In this preregistered multifactorial field experiment, we randomly varied three aspects of our code request’s wording in a 2x4x2 factorial design: the overall framing of our request (enhancement of social science research, response to replication crisis), the appeal why researchers should share their code (FAIR principles, academic altruism, prospect of citation, no information), and the perceived effort associated with code sharing (no code cleaning required, no information). Overall, 37.5\% of successfully contacted authors supplied their analysis code. Of our experimental treatments, only framing affected researchers’ code sharing behavior, though in the opposite direction we expected: Scientists who received the negative wording alluding to the replication crisis were more likely to share their research code. Taken together, our results highlight that the availability of research code will hardly be enhanced by small-scale individual interventions but instead requires large-scale institutional norms.},

  abstract = {We distinguish diagrammatic from sentential paper-and-pencil representations of information by developing alternative models of information-processing systems that are informationally equivalent and that can be characterized as sentential or diagrammatic. Sentential representations are sequential, like the propositions in a text. Diagrammatic representations are indexed by location in a plane. Diagrammatic representations also typically display information that is only implicit in sentential representations and that therefore has to be computed, sometimes at great cost, to make it explicit for use. We then contrast the computational efficiency of these representations for solving several illustrative problems in mathematics and physics. When two representations are informationally equivalent, their computational efficiency depends on the information-processing operators that act on them. Two sets of operators may differ in their capabilities for recognizing patterns, in the inferences they can carry out directly, and in their control strategies (in particular, the control of search). Diagrammatic and sentential representations support operators that differ in all of these respects. Operators working on one representation may recognize features readily or make inferences directly that are difficult to realize in the other representation. Most important, however, are differences in the efficiency of search for information and in the explicitness of information. In the representations we call diagrammatic, information is organized by location, and often much of the information needed to make an inference is present and explicit at a single location. In addition, cues to the next logical step in the problem may be present at an adjacent location. Therefore problem solving can proceed through a smooth traversal of the diagram, and may require very little search or computation of elements that had been implicit.},

  abstract = {As the availability of online data grows rapidly, researchers are confronted with a pressing question: How should social scientists collect Internet data for research? This study focuses on one of the most commonly used data collection techniques: web scraping. Going beyond canned approaches by leveraging a general framework of data communication, this study illustrates how online information can be systematically queried and fetched for reproducible research. To generalize our approaches, we additionally explore the variations in site security and architecture that analysts may encounter during the scraping process before they are given access to the desired data. The approaches we introduce do not rely on any proprietary software and can be easily implemented on any computing platform with programming languages such as Python or R. The methodological discussion in this study is meant to be applicable to current web-based research efforts. We include three examples with complete Python implementation. We also present an integrated workflow that enables researchers to produce analytical data sets that are traceable and thus verifiable for analysis or replication. Lastly, options related to the validity and efficiency of data are discussed, and we highlight the ongoing debate surrounding the ethics of online data collection, ultimately advocating for the fair use of online data.},

  abstract = {Technology driven changings with consecutive increase in the on-line availability and accessibility of journals and papers rapidly changes patterns of academic communication and publishing. The dissemination of important research findings through the academic and scientific community begins with publication in peer-reviewed journals. Aim of this article is to identify, critically evaluate and integrate the findings of relevant, high-quality individual studies addressing the trends of enhancement of visibility and accessibility of academic publishing in digital era. The number of citations a paper receives is often used as a measure of its impact and by extension, of its quality. Many aberrations of the citation practices have been reported in the attempt to increase impact of someone’s paper through manipulation with self-citation, inter-citation and citation cartels. Authors revenues to legally extend visibility, awareness and accessibility of their research outputs with uprising in citation and amplifying measurable personal scientist impact has strongly been enhanced by on line communication tools like networking (LinkedIn, Research Gate, Academia.edu, Google Scholar), sharing (Facebook, Blogs, Twitter, Google Plus) media sharing (Slide Share), data sharing (Dryad Digital Repository, Mendeley database, PubMed, PubChem), code sharing, impact tracking. Publishing in Open Access journals. Many studies and review articles in last decade have examined whether open access articles receive more citations than equivalent subscription toll access) articles and most of them lead to conclusion that there might be high probability that open access articles have the open access citation advantage over generally equivalent payfor-access articles in many, if not most disciplines. But it is still questionable are those never cited papers indeed “Worth(less) papers” and should journal impact factor and number of citations be considered as only suitable indicators to evaluate quality of scientists? “Publish or perish” phrase usually used to describe the pressure in academia to rapidly and continually publish academic work to sustain or further one’s career can now in 21. Century be reformulate into “Publish, be cited and maybe will not Perish”.           ,              Promjene pokretane tehnologijom koje posljedično dovode do uzastopnog povećanja on-line dostupnosti i pristupljivosti časopisima i znanstvenim radovima ubrzano mijenjaju obrasce akademske komunikacije i publiciranja. Širenje važnih otkrića u znanstvenoj zajednici počinje objavljivanjem u recenziranim časopisima. Svrha je ovoga članka prepoznati, kritički procijeniti i integrirati nalaze relevantnih, visokokvalitetnih individualnih studija koje se bave trendovima povećanja vidljivosti i pristupačnosti akademskoga izdavaštva u digitalnom dobu. Rezultati i diskusija: Broj citata koja pojedini znanstveni rad dobiva često se koristi kao mjera njegova utjecaja, a šire shvaćeno i njegove kvalitete. Zabilježene su mnoge aberacije u praksi citiranja kroz pokušaje povećanja utjecaja nečijega znanstvenoga rada manipuliranjem sa samocitiranjem, inter-citiranjem i udruživanjem u »citatne kartele«. Mogući putovi kojima bi autori mogli legalno povećati vidljivost i dostupnost svojih istraživačkih rezultata, s povećanjem broja citata i pojačavanjem mjerljivoga odjeka utjecaja, kako rada tako i znanstvenika, snažno su poboljšani on-line komunikacijskim alatima kao što su umrežavanje (LinkedIn, Research Gate, Academia.edu, Google Scholar), dijeljenje (Slide Share),dijeljenje podataka (Dryad Digital Repository, Mendeley database, PubMed, PubChem), dijeljenje koda, praćenje veličine utjecaja (Facebook, Blogovi, Twitter, Google Plus), te objavljivanjem u časopisima otvorenoga pristupa. Mnogi znanstveni i pregledni radovi u posljednjem desetljeću ispitali su hoće li se radovi objavljeni u časopisima s otvorenim pristupom više citirati u odnosu na radove objavljene u časopisima koji naplaćuju pristup, te većina rezultata upućuje na zaključak da bi mogla postojati komparativna prednost pri citiranju radova objavljenih uz otvoreni pristup u odnosu na drugu skupinu časopisa u mnogim, ako ne i u svim područjima znanosti. Ostaje upitno jesu li radovi koji ne budu nikad citirani doista i »bezvrijedni radovi«, te jesu li su faktor odjeka časopisa i broj citata doista jedini adekvatni indikatori za evaluaciju kvalitete znanstvenika? Zaključak: Frazu »Objavi ili nestani«, koju se obično koristi za opisivanje pritiska na članove akademske zajednice da brzo i neprekidno objavljuje znanstvene radove za održavanje ili napredak u daljnjoj karijeri, u 21. stoljeću se može preoblikovati u »Objavi i budi citiran, da možda ne bi nestao.«},

First, the elements of qualitative research are described and understood as an approach linked to the interpretation and meanings that are given to the world. Secondly, the functions and handling of the RQDA software are explained. The main feature of RQDA is the fact that it is a free and open-source cross-platform tool, which allows project administration for data management purposes. The results show that even with the limitations that this type of tool may have, they offer a series of advantages that make their use possible and desirable to develop quality social research. Regarding the conclusions section, a reflection is offered on the use of technology based on free software for social research purposes, which must consider the pros and cons during its implementation. Concepts such as that of open access, or free culture, incorporate various forms of attending to historical problems suffered by science and education.},

  abstract = {Knowledge about the software used in scientific investigations is necessary for different reasons, including provenance of the results, measuring software impact to attribute developers, and bibliometric software citation analysis in general. Additionally, providing information about whether and how the software and the source code are available allows an assessment about the state and role of open source software in science in general. While such analyses can be done manually, large scale analyses require the application of automated methods of information extraction and linking. In this paper, we present SoftwareKG—a knowledge graph that contains information about software mentions from more than 51,000 scientific articles from the social sciences. A silver standard corpus, created by a distant and weak supervision approach, and a gold standard corpus, created by manual annotation, were used to train an LSTM based neural network to identify software mentions in scientific articles. The model achieves a recognition rate of .82 F-score in exact matches. As a result, we identified more than 133,000 software mentions. For entity disambiguation, we used the public domain knowledge base DBpedia. Furthermore, we linked the entities of the knowledge graph to other knowledge bases such as the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph, the Software Ontology, and Wikidata. Finally, we illustrate, how SoftwareKG can be used to assess the role of software in the social sciences.},

A trend in F/OSS studies is the use of metadata stored in a repository of repositories or RoRs. This paper utilizes data obtained from such RoRs -FLOSSmole- to study the types of projects being developed by the F/OSS community. We downloaded projects by topics data in five areas (Database, Internet, Software Development, Communications, and Games/Entertainment) from Flossmole’s raw and summary data of the sourceforge repository. Time series analysis show the numbers of projects in the five topics are growing linearly. Further analysis supports our hypothesis that F/OSS development is moving “up the stack” from developer tools and infrastructure support to end-user applications such as Databases. The findings have implications for the interpretation of the F/OSS landscape, the utilization and adoption of open source databases, and problems researchers might face in obtaining and using data from RoRs.},

Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are visual representations of causal assumptions that are increasingly used in modern epidemiology. They can help to identify the presence of confounding for the causal question at hand. This structured approach serves as a visual aid in the scientific discussion by making underlying relations explicit. This article explains the basic concepts of DAGs and provides examples in the field of nephrology with and without presence of confounding. Ultimately, these examples will show that DAGs can be preferable to the traditional methods to identify sources of confounding, especially in complex research questions.},

While several proposals concerning the evaluation of costs and benefits exist, little attention has been given to the evaluation of technical qualities and, in general, to the “usage-oriented” issues. In this paper the existing proposals are examined, the different types of qualities and issues that are relevant to potential users are described, and a coherent and innovative method for the evaluation of OSS is proposed. The proposed method is expected to support the potential user in the evaluation and choice of OSS in a flexible way, taking into account all the aspects that are relevant to the user.},

  abstract = {"This book deals with the theory and practice in the design of data graphics and makes the point that the most effective way to describe, explore, and summarize a set of numbers is to look at pictures of those numbers, through the use of statistical graphics, charts, and tables. It includes 250 illustrations of the best (and a few of the worst) statistical graphics, with detailed analysis of how to display data for precise, effective, quick analysis. Also offered is information on the design of the high-resolution displays, small multiples, editing and improving graphics, and the data-ink ratio. Time-series, relational graphics, data maps, multivariate designs, as well as detection of graphical deception: design variation vs. data variation, and sources of deception are discussed. Information on aesthetics and data graphical displays is included. The 2nd edition provides high-resolution color reproductions of the many graphics of William Playfair (1750-1800), adds color to other images where appropriate, and includes all the changes and corrections during the 17 printings of the 1st edition"--Publisher's description},

Due to personal or institutional financial constraints, the purchase of commercial software is not a wise investment for all researchers. Hence, this article aims to provide a review of nine different free-of-charge and low-cost software tools for studying Twitter and highlights their advantages and disadvantages, in order to serve as a guide for social science scholars. This review is divided into two parts: background information and data retrieval features of the software tools, and their data analysis features. At the end of the review, several recommendations and suggestions are made for the use of these tools.},

  abstract = {Citation is considered as an essential part in any academic writing whereby it is one way for writers to support any claims or arguments made in their study with literature from previous research. Literature review is known as a chapter which provides background for research described in a thesis. However, relatively not many studies are done on literature review chapter of thesis which may be due to the extensive nature of the text. Writing academic texts such as a thesis requires an author to acknowledge other researchers’ work through proper use of citations. Learning the appropriate way to cite is important in any kinds of academic writing especially among research students who are writing their theses. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate the citation practices in doctoral theses of Chemical Engineering. The purpose of this study is two folds; i) to identify the types of citations used in the corpus (using Swale's 1990 categorization) and ii) to examine the functions related to the citations used (using Thompson's 2001 framework). Three literature review chapters were analysed first to identify the types of citations used in the mini corpus and the functions related to the citations. The results of the study show that engineering student writers mostly used Non-integral citations as compared to Integral. The study concludes with a discussion on the skills of citing the literature which should be given more attention to raise the awareness level among students.},
